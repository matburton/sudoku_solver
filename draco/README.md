This is an implementation using the Draco programming lanaguge for m68k Amigas
with anything greater than kickstart 1.2 and and the original chip set (OCS)

# Draco

At the time of writing Draco was available from here:
- http://aminet.net/package/dev/lang/Draco-m68k

# Support platforms

I aim to support execution on any m68k Amiga with kickstrat 1.2 or greater

I aim to support compilation on any m68k Amiga with kickstart 1.2 or
greater with 512kB of RAM or greater under workbench 1.2 or greater
